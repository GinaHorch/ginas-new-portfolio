## Overview

The **End-to-End Data Engineering Project** showcases the implementation of a **fully functional data pipeline** using tools from the modern data stack. This project follows an **Extract, Load, Transform (ELT)** approach, integrating multiple technologies to efficiently process data for a **fictional e-commerce company**. 

It highlights **data modeling, pipeline orchestration, testing, documentation, and version control**, providing a **real-world demonstration of data engineering best practices**.

## Key Features

- **Data Ingestion**: Airbyte is used to extract data from multiple sources and load it into a PostgreSQL database.
- **Data Transformation**: dbt (Data Build Tool) is employed for modular, SQL-based transformations.
- **Orchestration**: Dagster manages and schedules the pipeline execution in a structured and scalable manner.
- **Dockerised Environment**: The pipeline is fully containerised, ensuring reproducibility and ease of deployment.
- **Version Control & Documentation**: Git is used for collaboration and code management, while detailed documentation outlines workflow efficiency.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming & Scripting**: Python
- **Data Ingestion**: Airbyte
- **Data Transformation**: dbt (Data Build Tool)
- **Pipeline Orchestration**: Dagster
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Development Tools**: Git, Visual Studio Code
- **Deployment**: Docker

## Challenges and Learnings

- **Pipeline Orchestration**: Managing dependencies and execution flow efficiently using Dagster.
- **Scalability Considerations**: Designing a modular and scalable architecture to accommodate different data sources.

## Outcome

This project **deepened my expertise in modern data engineering workflows**, solidified my understanding of **ELT architecture**, and **enhanced my ability to coach Agile teams** in refining their delivery pipelines. The integration of **Airbyte, dbt, and Dagster** in a **Dockerised environment** demonstrates my ability to build and manage scalable data solutions.
