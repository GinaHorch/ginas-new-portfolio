## Overview

The **Job Application Tracker** is a Flask-based web application designed to help users effectively manage their job search. 
Users can securely track job applications, monitor deadlines, and follow up on opportunities, all from one convenient location. 
This project showcases expertise in back-end and front-end integration, responsive design, and practical application of Agile 
principles to deliver a user-friendly tool.

## Key Features

- **User Authentication**: Secure signup and login functionality using Flask-Login.
- **Dashboard**: A central hub to view all job applications, filter by status, company, or due date.
- **Job Management**: Add, edit, view, and delete job applications seamlessly.
- **Follow-Up Reminders**: Highlight overdue or upcoming follow-up dates to help users stay on track.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimised for both desktop and mobile users.

## Technologies Used

- **Backend**: Flask, Flask-SQLAlchemy, Flask-WTF, Flask-Login, Flask-Migrate
- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, JavaScript
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for production (hosted on Heroku), SQLite for local development
- **Deployment**: Heroku for hosting the live application

## Challenges and Learnings

- **Balancing Simplicity and Functionality**: Designing an intuitive interface while including essential features like filtering and follow-up reminders.
- **Database Migrations**: Managing seamless database migrations between local development (SQLite) and production (PostgreSQL).
- **Responsive Design**: Ensuring consistent user experiences across devices with Bootstrap's mobile-first approach.

## Outcome

The **Job Application Tracker** was successfully deployed to Heroku, allowing users to access the tool online. 
This project deepened my understanding of Flask and back-end development while refining my front-end design skills. 
It also reinforced the importance of sharing practical, reusable solutions with others in my She Codes cohort. 
This experience enriched my ability as a Scrum Master to support Agile teams in refining workflows and delivering 
impactful, user-focused products.
