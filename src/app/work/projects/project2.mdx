# Overview

**The Good List** is a web application designed to streamline the holiday shopping experience by allowing users to create and manage wishlists and shopping lists. 
Users can categorise gifts, and will soon be able to set budgets, and share lists with family and friends while maintaining privacy controls.

## Meet the "Debugging Ducks"
As the **Scrum Master**, I coordinated sprints, managed stakeholder communication, and maintained project momentum. I established and upheld Scrum within the team, 
facilitating key events such as Sprint Planning, Team Syncs, a Sprint Review, and a Retrospective. My responsibilities included:

- Servant leadership and removing impediments that blocked team progress. 
- Ensuring the team followed Agile best practices and delivered high-value increments meeting the **Definition of Done** (DoD).
- Ensuring smooth collaboration and coaching team members in cross-functionality.
- Driving continuous improvement and fostering a high-performing, collaborative team culture.
- Ensuring the team worked in an iterative cycle, incorporating client feedback to refine our product. 

- **Afira Zulkifli & Lisa Todesco (Full Stack Developers)**: 
  Built robust APIs using Django Rest Framework, ensuring secure authentication and scalability.
  Integrated frontend features seamlessly with backend APIs to provide a smooth user experience.
- **Bianca Di Biase & Sulakshna Andotra (Frontend Developers)**: 
  Created a responsive, intuitive UI using React.
  Bianca also led the design efforts, ensuring a cohesive and visually appealing user experience, while both focused on enhancing accessibility and usability.

## Key Features
### MVP Features (Completed)

- **Testing Tools**: Insomnia for API testing
- **Others**: GitHub for version control, Slack for team communication, Trello for Kanban

## Challenges and Learnings
One of our biggest challenges was understanding what is truly achievable within a three-week timeframe and balancing our initial vision with realistic implementation. 
We started with an ambitious MVP, packed with features, but through collaboration and guidance from our lead mentor, we learned to refine it into a focused and 
scalable MVP—one that delivers core functionality while allowing for future growth.

This experience highlighted the importance of **agile decision-making**, as we had to continuously reassess priorities, pivot when needed, and ensure that every 
feature contributed meaningfully to the end goal.

As **Scrum Master**, it was reassuring to see that **inclusiveness and collaboration** were the foundation of our team culture. 
Every decision was shaped by open discussion, mutual support, and a shared commitment to building something valuable. 
This project reinforced that a strong team culture is just as important as technical execution, and that adaptability is key in any development process.

## Outcome
On 4 February 2025, we successfully presented The Good List to our client, receiving positive feedback on the final product and its potential for future enhancements.

Through iterative development and strategic decision-making, we delivered an MVP that met all core requirements while maintaining scalability for additional 
features. This process reinforced our ability to adapt, prioritise, and execute efficiently under time constraints.

Beyond the technical implementation, this project strengthened our collaboration and Agile development skills. We navigated challenges as a team, refining our 
ability to communicate, pivot, and problem-solve together. Most importantly, we created a product we’re proud of—one that reflects the creativity, dedication, 
and teamwork that made this experience so rewarding.
