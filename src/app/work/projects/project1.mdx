## Overview

Full-stack crowdfunding platform supporting cultural programs for Aboriginal children in care, showcasing expertise in API design, responsive frontend development, and secure deployment across scalable cloud services.

## Key Features

- **Crowdfunding Functionality**: Organisations can create and update cultural projects for Aboriginal children in care and Users can browse all projects or filter by categories and create, update, and pledge to money towards projects they would like to support.
- **Comprehensive API**: Includes token-based authentication, role-based permissions, and secure endpoints for projects and pledges.
- **Real-Time Data Interactions**: Frontend and backend integration to synchronise project data dynamically.
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first and accessible interface to ensure usability across all devices.
- **Image Storage**: Integration with AWS S3 Buckets for secure image uploads and storage.
- **Security and Integrity**: Strict permission controls to safeguard data and ensure only authorised actions are performed.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: JavaScript, React, React.js, CSS, Netlify
- **Backend**: Python, Django, Django Rest Framework, SQLite, PostgreSQL, Gunicorn
- **DevOps**: Heroku, AWS S3 Buckets
- **Testing Tools**: Insomnia
- **Others**: boto3 for AWS integration

## Challenges and Learnings

- **Aligning Backend and Frontend**: Ensured consistent data flows and synchronisation between the API and user interface, which required careful debugging and iteration.
- **Failed Migrations**: Overcame several failed database migrations, learning the importance of version control and robust migration planning.
- **AWS S3 Integration**: Faced significant challenges configuring AWS S3 Buckets for secure image storage, gaining deeper insights into cloud storage and deployment pipelines.

## Outcome

Although this project was part of the She Codes Australia - Plus program and not deployed for real-world use, it provided an invaluable learning experience in full-stack development. It demonstrated the potential for scaling into a real-world application, combining user-friendly interfaces with robust backend services. This project solidified my ability to manage end-to-end development workflows and deliver functional, secure, and user-focused solutions.
