## Overview

The **Redux To-Do App** is a state-managed **task management tool** built using **Vite, React, TypeScript, and Redux Toolkit**. It supports **adding, completing, deleting, and filtering tasks** while ensuring **state persistence** via **Redux Persist**.

This project **demonstrates scalable state management practices** and **enhances user experience through a responsive and intuitive UI**.

## Key Features

- **State Management with Redux Toolkit**: Handles to-do operations efficiently.
- **Redux Persist Integration**: Ensures tasks persist across page refreshes.
- **Task Filtering**: View tasks by **All, Completed, or Pending** states.
- **Optimised Performance with Vite**: Ensures fast development and builds.
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts seamlessly to **mobile and desktop** screens.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, Vite
- **State Management**: Redux Toolkit, Redux Persist
- **Styling**: CSS Modules for scoped styling
- **Development Tools**: Git, GitHub, Visual Studio Code

## Challenges and Learnings

- **Implementing Redux Persist**: Ensured seamless data retention.
- **Component Optimisation**: Managed state effectively to prevent unnecessary re-renders.
- **Responsive UI Design**: Used **CSS Modules** to create a visually appealing, mobile-friendly experience.

## Outcome

This project strengthened my expertise in **React state management with Redux Toolkit**, improved my ability to create **scalable and performant applications**, and demonstrated **best practices in modular architecture**. ðŸš€
