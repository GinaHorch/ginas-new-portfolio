### 1. **Customer satisfaction** through continuous delivery of valuable software.

"Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software."

### 2. **Welcome change**, even late in development.

"Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer's competitive advantage."

### 3. Deliver working software **frequently**.

"Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale."

### 4. Collaboration between **business stakeholders and developers**.

"Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project."

### 5. Build projects around **motivated individuals**.

"Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done."

### 6. Prioritise face-to-face communication.

"The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation."

### 7. Measure progress by **working software**.

"Working software is the primary measure of progress."

### 8. Maintain a **sustainable** development pace.

"Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely."

### 9. Continuously focus on **technical excellence** and good design.

"Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility."

### 10. **Simplicity** - the art of maximising work not done - is essential.

"Simplicity--the art of maximizing the amount of work not done--is essential."

### 11. Teams should **self-organise** for optimal results.

"The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams."

### 12. Regularly reflect on how to become **more effective** and adjust behaviour accordingly.

"At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly."
