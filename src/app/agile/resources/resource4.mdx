# Key Points

* Scrum is a team-based framework for breaking work into smaller, manageable pieces, delivered incrementally.

* Scrum includes continuous experimentation and feedback loops to foster improvement.

* Scrum integrates into existing workflows while optimising practices for specific team needs.

* **Core Focus**: Collaboration, iterative processes, and delivering value.

- **Scrum Team**: Product Owner, Scrum Master, Developers

- **Five Events**: Sprint, Sprint Planning, Daily Scrum, Sprint Review, Sprint Retrospective

- **Three Artifacts**: Product Backlog, Sprint Backlog, Increment

- **Definition of Done (DoD)** and Acceptance Criteria

## The Scrum Framework

- Defined in **The Scrum Guide**, first introduced in 1995 by Ken Schwaber and Jeff Sutherland.

- Inspired by rugby scrums - the **team collaborates** to move the product forward.

- Empirical process: Relies on the three pillars **transparency, inspection, and adaptation**.

- **Trust** is a key characteristic that binds Scrum Team members together.

## Principles of Scrum

- Scrum operates in **short cycles (Sprints)** of one month or less, delivering increments of valuable work.

- Feedback during Sprints enables **inspection and adaptation** of both process and deliverables.

- Emphasis on **experimentation** as a core mechanism for progress.

## Values of Scrum foster Trust and Collaboration

- **Courage**

- **Focus**

- **Commitment**

- **Respect** 

- **Openness**

## What is Professional Scrum?

- Goes beyond the mechanics of the framework, requiring:

-- A **mindset shift** in how work is approached and executed.

-- An **environment of trust** to support Scrum practices.

-- Full **adoption of Scrum Values** in all aspects of work.

- Avoids "going through the motions" and emphasises **purposeful, value-driven execution**.
