Every career is a journey, filled with challenges, growth, and those significant moments that mark a shift in our path. Today, I’m excited to share that I’ve arrived at a new milestone in my career—one that is both a culmination of past experiences and a stepping stone toward future aspirations.

## Reflecting on the Journey So Far

Looking back, it’s clear that each phase of my career has built upon the last, guiding me to where I stand today. From my early days of learning the basics and struggling through complex projects, to gaining confidence through real-world experience, each step has shaped my skills and mindset. I’ve learned that design and engineering are as much about problem-solving and creativity as they are about resilience and continuous learning.
