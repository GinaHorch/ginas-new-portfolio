# What is the Agile Manifesto?

- A lightweight framework that outlines values and principles for Agile software development.

- Created to improve efficiency and innovation in software development compared to traditional methods (e.g., Waterfall)

- Focuses on streamlining processes while delivering maximum value to customers.

- Developed by 17 industry experts in 2001 during a meeting in Snowbird, Utah.

- Contains 4 values and 12 principles that have redefined software development and project management.

## The Four Agile Values

### Individuals and interactions OVER processes and tools

- Prioritises people over rigid tools and processes.

- Real-time communication and teamwork are more effective than waiting for processes to catch up.

- Example: A team collaborates quickly to fix a bug rather than waiting for formal procedures.

- Why it works: Conversations solve problems faster than relying solely on tools.

### Working software OVER comprehensive documentation

- Emphasises delivering functional software over excessive documentation.

- Documentation supports development but should not delay it.

- Example: A startup builds a prototype for user testing instead of perfecting every technical spec upfront.

- Why it works: A functional product delivers value faster than incomplete documents.

### Customer collaboration OVER contract negotiation

- Encourages working with customers throughout the development process.

- Focuses on adapting to customer feedback rather than rigidly sticking to predefined contracts.

- Example: A UX team tweaks the design based on usability tests rather than following the original scope.

- Why it works: Prioritising customer needs ensures better results than rigid agreements.

### Responding to change OVER following a plan

- Agile embraces adaptability to meet evolving needs and market demands.

- Plans are important, but flexibility is critical for success.

- Example: A product team pivots to differentiate their dashboard after a competitor launches a similar feature.

- Why it works: Flexibility allows teams to stay relevant in dynamic markets.
