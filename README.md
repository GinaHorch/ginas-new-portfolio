## **Overview**
This portfolio was built using [Once UI's Magic Portfolio](https://once-ui.com), leveraging its design system while implementing significant customisations to tailor it to my needs.

### **Key Learning Curve & Deployment Challenges**

Building and deploying this portfolio provided a valuable learning experience, particularly in:

- **Optimising code & reducing payload size** to comply with **1MB deployment restrictions** on Vercel.
- **Tree-shaking dependencies** to minimise unnecessary package loads.
- **Dynamic routing and metadata generation** using Next.js.
- **Implementing UI enhancements**, including interactive modals and Agile resource structuring.

## **Custom Features & Enhancements**
Beyond the original Once-UI template, I introduced several **custom features** to improve usability, accessibility, and interactivity.

### **🔹 Acknowledgement Pop-Up**
